        <h2 id="h2">Here's a timeline of Greta Thunberg's actions against climate change:</h2>
        <ul id="ul">
          <li><b>2003</b> - Born in Stockholm, Sweden.</li>
          <li><b>early 2018</b> - Founds a movement known as Fridays for Future (also called School Strike for Climate).</li>
          <li><b>Dec, 2018</b> - speech during the plenary session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP24). he commented that the world leaders present were "not mature enough to tell it like it is".</li>
          <li><b>Jan, 2019</b> - speech in World Economic Forum, in which she declared: "Our house is on fire."</li>
          <li><b>Aug, 2019</b> - sailed across the Atlantic Ocean from Plymouth, England, to New York, USA, in the 60-foot (18 m) racing yacht Malizia II, equipped with solar panels and underwater turbines. The trip was announced as a carbon-neutral transatlantic crossing serving as a demonstration of her declared beliefs of the importance of reducing emissions.</li>
          <li><b>Sep, 2019</b> - invited to give testimony in the US House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. Instead of giving testimony, she gave an eight sentence statement and submitted the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C as evidence.</li>
          <li><b>Sep, 2019</b> - attended the UN Climate Action Summit in New York City, where she met a group of other young activists and together they made an official complaint against five nations that were not on track to meet the emission reduction targets they committed to in their Paris Agreement pledges: Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, and Turkey.</li>
          <li><b>Sep, 2019</b> - participated in climate protests in the cities of Montreal, Edmonton and Vancouver including leading a climate rally as part of the Global Climate Strike in Montreal. Hundreds of thousands took part in the protest described as the largest in the city's history.</li>
          <li><b>Dec, 2019</b> - travelled on to Madrid to speak at COP25 and to participate with the local Fridays for Future climate strikers. During a press conference before the march, she called for more "concrete action", arguing that the global wave of school strikes over the previous year had "achieved nothing" because greenhouse gas emissions were still rising—by 4% since 2015.</li>
          <li><b>Jan, 2020</b> - returned to the World Economic Forum held in Davos, Switzerland, delivered two speeches, and participated in panel discussions hosted by The New York Times and the World Economic Forum. Thunberg used many of the themes contained in her previous speeches, but focused on one in particular: "Our house is still on fire." Thunberg joked that she cannot complain about not being heard, saying: "I am being heard all the time."</li>
          <li><b>Mar, 2020</b> - attended an extraordinary meeting of the European Parliament's Environment Committee to talk about the European Climate Law. There she declared that she considered the new proposal for a climate law published by the European Commission to be a surrender.</li>
          <li><b>Dec, 2020</b> - used Twitter to criticize the New Zealand Labour Government's recent climate change emergency declaration as "virtue signalling", tweeting that New Zealand's Labour Government had only committed to reducing less than one percent of New Zealand's carbon emissions by 2025. In response, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and climate change Minister James Shaw defended New Zealand's climate change declaration as only the start of the country's climate change mitigation goals.</li>
          <li><b>Apr, 2021</b> - together with other climate activists, launched the annual Climate Live concert to highlight climate change.</li>
          <li><b>May, 2021</b> - urged a change in the food production system and the protection of animals and their habitats. She said that the way humans are destroying habitats are the perfect conditions for the spread of diseases and noted zoonotic illnesses such as COVID-19, Zika, Ebola, West Nile fever, SARS, MERS, among others.</li>
          <li><b>Sep, 2021</b> - criticized U.S. president Joe Biden, British prime minister Boris Johnson, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and other world leaders over their promises to address the climate crisis in a speech at the Youth4Climate Summit in Milan. She also criticized and doubted organizers of climate conferences, saying "They invite cherry-picked young people to meetings like this to pretend they are listening to us. But they are not.</li>
          <li><b>Oct, 2021</b> - took part in a protest in London, demanding the financial system stops funding companies and projects that use fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. The protest in London is part of a series taking place at the financial centres around the world, including New York City, San Francisco and Nairobi. She told the BBC journalist Andrew Marr that banks should "stop funding our destruction", ahead of the UN COP26 climate summit.</li>
          <li><b>Nov, 2021</b> - together with other climate activists, began filing a petition to the United Nations calling it to declare a level 3 global climate emergency. This should lead to the creation of a special team that will coordinate the response to the climate crisis in the international level.</li>
          <li><b>Jul, 2022</b> - criticized the European Parliament on Twitter for voted to label fossil gas as "green" energy. She continued by stating that the result will delay a "desperately needed real sustainable transition and deepen our dependency on Russian fuels. The hypocrisy is striking, but unfortunately not surprising."</li>
          <li><b>Sep, 2022</b> - criticized the government for spending "all their time distracting, delaying and denying the necessary changes ahead of us. The emissions of CO2 are not reducing - they are still increasing." She continued by stating: "The world is still expanding fossil fuel infrastructure and pouring astronomical amounts of money into destruction. We are still speeding in the wrong direction. There is indeed a long way ahead of us - but we are still here and we are not planning on going anywhere."</li>
